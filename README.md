# Emotion Detection System using DistilBERT

## Overview

This project is a multi-label Emotion Detection System built using **DistilBERT** and fine-tuned on the **GoEmotions** dataset. The model predicts multiple emotions from user-provided text and displays the detected emotions along with their confidence scores through a Streamlit web interface.

This project demonstrates the complete NLP workflow including data preprocessing, transformer fine-tuning, model evaluation, and deployment with Streamlit.

## Example

Input:

```
I was terrified before the interview, but after getting selected I felt relieved, excited, and grateful.
```

Output:

```
Gratitude
Relief
Excitement
Optimism
```

### How to use the model

1. Download the ZIP file from the Google Drive link above.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Place the extracted `emotion_model` folder inside the project directory.

Your project structure should look like:

```
Emotion-Detection-System/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── emotion_model/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── model.safetensors
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── training_args.bin
│
└── Clean_GoEmotions_DistilBERT_Colab_Notebook.ipynb
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Future Improvements
